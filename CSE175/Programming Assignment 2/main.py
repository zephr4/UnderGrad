# This script provides a top-level driver to exercise a knowledge base
# concerning a midnight murder by monsters. General knowledge is
# imported from the "knowledge.py" file. A specific murder case is
# encoded in the definite clauses in "case_sentences". General
# knowledge is concatenated with case knowledge to produce a
# first-order logic knowledge base, consisting only of definite
# clauses. The driver asks a backward chaining inference procedure
# to indicate which individuals can be proven to have participated
# in the death of innocent victims.
