# game.py
#
# This Python script file provides the infrastructure needed to play
# the Guardian Game. In particular, a Game class is provided which captures
# both the parameters of a whole game (e.g., who goes first, who won) and
# the current state of play (e.g., player locations, current motion action).
# The Guardian is in location zero, the West player has a negative valued
# location, and the East player has a positive valued location. The West
# play is always the computer player, and the East player is the human
# opponent. The player who gets the first turn is specified upon creation
# or during initialization of the game.
#
# The computer player's action choices are determined by calls to the
# function "minimax_action", which is implemented elsewhere. Games are
# initiated by the "play" method.
