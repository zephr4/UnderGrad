# Exercise 1. Implement the algorithm covered in lectures (and not any other algorithm) that determines if an integer n is prime. Your function should return True, if n is prime, and False otherwise. Your algorithm has to be effective for n ~ 1,000,000,000,000.

					return False

# Exercise 2. Using the isPrime function above, implement a function that takes in an integer n, and returns the smallest prime number greater than n. Your code should computer in a reasonable time for n ~ 1,000,000,000,000.

		i = n + 2

			i = i + 2
 	return i
      


# Exercise 3. It is sometimes necessary to find all prime numbers less than some integer n. Implement a function that takes in an integer n and returns a list of all primes that are less than or equal to n. Your algorithm should be effective for n ~ 1,000,000

# Exercsie 4. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that every positive integer n, can be expressed uniquely as a product of primes in non-decreasing order. Implement the method covered in class (and not any other method), for finding prime factorizations of integers. The function below should take in an integer n, and return a list of the prime factors of n.

# Exercise 5. The scrurity of many popular cryptographic schemes, such as RSA, rests on the fact that factorizing numbers is difficult, meaning that it takes long to factorize some numbers. Use your code from exrecise 4 to experiment with different inputs and try to figure out what makes some numbers take longer to factorize than others. Explain what you found in the string/comment below

ex5answer = """
Write your answer for exercise 5 within the triple-double quotes:

It is difficult to factorize very large prime numbers. This is because prime only have two factors: one and itself. 
This means if we try to find all factors of a prime number that is in the billions, or larger, we must check every number between one and our prime number, 
only to realize that there are two factors, one and itself.

# Exercise 6. In some cryptographic applications, it is necessary to use a special kind of prime numbers called safe primes. These are primes of the form q = 2p + 1, where p is also prime. The integer p is known as a Sophie Germain prime. Write a function that takes in an integer n, and returns the first safe prime, such that p > n. Your function should output a tuple (p, q), comprising the Sophie Germain prime, and the safe prime.
